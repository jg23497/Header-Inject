ðŸ“¢ _I created Header Inject to meet a personal need, prompted by the requirements of my test environment, and was pleased to be able to share the Chrome extension with 2,000+ active users._

_However, I no longer have the need for Header Inject and lack the time and inclination to maintain it. Furthermore, unless we're able to [migrate to v3 of the Chrome Extension Manifest](https://github.com/jg23497/Header-Inject/issues/4), then the extension will soon run the risk of being disabled by Google for failing to migrate to the new manifest version._

_As of July 4th, 2024, this repository will be archived._

# Header Inject

[![Unit tests](https://github.com/jg23497/Header-Inject/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/jg23497/Header-Inject/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)

## Background

**An open-source Chrome extension for injecting or overriding HTTP request headers. Simply.**

After installation, access Header Inject's quick options panel by clicking the extension's icon or opening its options tab. The options view allows you to configure custom HTTP headers and to enable HTTP header injection, which is disabled by default when the extension is first installed. 

Header Inject uses Chrome's synchronised storage mechanism, meaning its configuration is automatically synchronised to any Chrome browser you are logged in to.

## Test

Header Inject relies on the [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io) unit testing framework. Assuming [Python 3](https://www.python.org) is installed, you can run the unit tests in your favourite browser:

```
python run-tests-in-browser.py
``` 

Or use the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, assuming [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed:

```
cd tests
npm i
karma start
```

Karma is configured to produce a unit test coverage report. After a test run completes, the report will be available at `tests/coverage`.

## Publish


On Windows:

```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --pack-extension=<path>\HeaderInject\src
```
